## Description

### 52°North's backbone for OGC services, clients and middleware

**A framework for developing OGC services, clients and middleware sharing concepts for encoding and decoding of different formats and encodings, workflows and configuration.**

Arctic Sea is a stack of projects that eases the development of OGC related services such as the 52°North implementation of the OGC [SOS](https://github.com/52North/SOS) and [WPS](https://github.com/52North/javaPS), as well as clients and middleware. It compromises the following modules.

![Overview](https://github.com/52North/arctic-sea/raw/master/etc/overview.jpg)

#### Iceland [![Maven Central](https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/org.n52.arctic-sea/iceland.svg)](https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:org.n52.arctic-sea%20and%20a:iceland*%20and%20p:jar)

Iceland is a service framework that enables the development of OGC RPC based services. It features bindings for KVP, POX, SOAP, as well as JSON-based bindings. Iceland facilitates the rapid development of modular services that use Faroe for easy configuration and Svalbard for request parsing and response generation.

#### Svalbard [![Maven Central](https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/org.n52.arctic-sea/svalbard.svg)](https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:org.n52.arctic-sea%20and%20a:svalbard*%20and%20p:jar)

Svalbard consists of various decoders and encoders for OGC models (e.g. [SensorML](http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/sensorml), [O&M](http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/om) and [SWE Common](http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/swecommon), service interfaces (like [SOS](http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/sos) and [WPS](http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/wps)) and a framework for developing these. This enables the creation of decoupled and reusable encoders and decoders for various encodings (e.g. XML, JSON or NetCDF). The object models used are found in 52°North Shetland and are shared across 52°North components.

#### Faroe [![Maven Central](https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/org.n52.arctic-sea/faroe.svg)](https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:org.n52.arctic-sea%20and%20a:faroe*%20and%20p:jar)

Faroe is a configuration API currently featuring a JSON and a SQLite backend. It enables the injection and automatic configuration of settings of various types in classes, including a Spring `BeanPostprocessor`.

#### Shetland [![Maven Central](https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/org.n52.arctic-sea/shetland.svg)](https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:org.n52.arctic-sea%20and%20a:shetland*%20and%20p:jar)

Shetland consists of classes for OGC models like [SensorML](http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/sensorml), [O&M](http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/om) and [SWE Common](http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/swecommon) and various service requests and responses. These are shared across different service implementations.

#### Jan Mayen [![Maven Central](https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/org.n52.arctic-sea/janmayen.svg)](https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:org.n52.arctic-sea%20and%20a:janmayen*%20and%20p:jar)

Jan Mayen contains various utility classes shared across Arctic Sea.

### Key Technologies

- OGC Web Services
- Web Processing Service (WPS)
- Sensor Observation Service (SOS)
- SWE Common
- SensorML
- Observation and Measurement (O&M)
- Spring
- Java
- XML

### Benefits

- The middleware component provides a robust layer to easily create web services compliant to OGC standards.
- The configuration API enables harmonized management of service properties.
- Centralized XML encoding and decoding reduces increases stability.
